      <h3> Get To Know Me</h3>
      <h4>Past</h4>
      <p> I grew in a very small city in Southern Colorado. I was extremely involved in extra-curricular activities and using everything nature had to offer. Although I loved to keep myself busy with that variation, my heart always belonged in dance. I am very thankful that I am still able to continue that passion through choreography. </p>
      <h4>Present</h4>
      <p> Being passionate in multiple areas of your life is incredible until it comes time to pick a career. There have always been many things that I enjoyed, but nothing that I could see propeling my future. Finding Thinkful is exactly what I needed to see that I can have a career that is both interesting and practical. Creativity is a huge portion of my life and I truly believe that software development is the perfect mix between technology and innovation. </p>
      <h4>Future</h4>
      <p> I am unsure of what the future holds for my career, but these are my current goals:</p>
